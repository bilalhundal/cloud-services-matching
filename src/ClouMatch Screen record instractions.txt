 I am running the project and performing acceptance test through
PostMant, and also showing working of logs and writing logs working 
into log file 
 first with two providers aws and gcp
only there is one unmatched which I itentionally inserted 
I am showing in database

now performing with three providers 
only three properties are matched showing you in database
only one in azure not matched

now I am running with unit test before showing you test implementations
of unit and integration tests
sorry first see logs working I am clearing previous logs and you
can see new one after compare method called now running project
in test mode , I have implemented test on services and Api Controller
class 
There are six test I am showing you all
I have inserted docs commented on all code class and methods
In Next video I am showing you database work and explaing about 
your concern of getting all properties but I will show you
only specific path related properties fron canonical and
providers are fetched First I will show you database architect
you can see there is canonical service path field in database
that is foriegn key of canonicalservicetaxonomy because there
is no attribute of canonical_service_path in properties showing
you in code now please have look into database structure how
it gets created same thing in case of UnGeograph table 
all providers geography table holding Ungeography table primary key
as foreign key showing you in code

Now I am showing you this programmatically by showing input in console
after getting properties with specific path for this first 
have look into database table of CanonicalTaxonomy and AwsProperties
for example we will add new path and program on getting this path
will fecth only properties related to that path here you can
see in options only primary key of canonicaltaxonomyservice 
showing you in next video part you can see on unmatched in aws
for this service because this is only in aws properties table

now please have look in console I am writing code for that
on highligthed line code is for fetching taxonomy service with
service name and it fetch only relavent properties to the path
of given service name Running this code in next video and showing
you output now try with other servicename
